# Research log

## 2026-08-18

- Defined the preservation-first project scope.
- Recovered the BixCheck 5.x manual and three vendor software packages.
- Identified BixCheck's Monitor, calibration, telemetry, logging, Checkout, and Downloader functions.
- Recorded the factory cable part number and J3 location from vendor documentation.
- Established the reliability requirement: the smart layer must not impair factory operation.

## 2026-08-19

- Built the first OpenMaxFire v0.1 Python protocol/CLI skeleton.
- Statically reconstructed `CRXX` and `CWXXYY` command encodings from BixCheck 5.5.01.
- Reconstructed remote OFF/ON/UP/DOWN writes to controller register 0x0E.
- Recorded the owner's stove/PCB identification details.
- Investigated door-state feasibility and automatic heating-source coordination.

## 2026-08-20

- Extracted embedded `Bixby_0271_080315.hex` from BixCheck 5.5.01.
- Parsed and disassembled firmware 2.71 as PIC16F877A code.
- Annotated the reset vector, UART setup, ASCII-hex decoder, read/write parser, CR register handlers, and response terminator.
- Identified UART register values `SPBRG=0x20`, `TXSTA=0x26`, and `RCSTA=0x90`.
- Mapped CR00-CR0E static handlers and narrowed door-switch candidates to CR02/CR06 input bits.
- Created this structured GitHub archive and documented the 19.2/38.4 kbaud conflict.
